# Pygame Raycasting Demo

This is a basic Wolfenstein-style raycasting engine written in Python using Pygame. It features first-person 3D rendering based on a 2D map image, directional movement, and ray-based wall projection.

## Controls

| Key       | Action                       |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| `W`       | Move forward                 |
| `S`       | Move backward                |
| `A`       | Strafe left                  |
| `D`       | Strafe right                 |
| `← →`     | Rotate left/right            |
| `M`       | Toggle between 2D/3D view    |

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

2. You can play with just sample.png but if you'd like to randomly generate your own maps you can use my [maze generator](https://github.com/amw720386/MazeGenerator)
